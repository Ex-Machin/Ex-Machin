Content management — Associating the right CMS with your project based on the features you need and the client you’re building for.
Content delivery — Improving load times by choosing what content should be delivered and which networks are best suited to that content.
Source control — Using Git, SVN, or similar programs to track your work and minimize conflicts with other programmers.

Information architecture — Organizing and structuring a website before you even write a line of code, via wireframes and other tools.
Back-end development — Grasping at least the basics of server-side code, APIs, and databases so as to intelligently communicate with your back-end counterpart(s).
Readable, well-documented code — Writing code that is not only functional, but also understandable and consistently formatted for the next generation of maintainers.
Efficient and organized development workflows — Utilizing the right tools to track bugs, hours, ideas, messaging, and more.
Client management — Sorting out the differences between requests, requirements, and reality (and doing it politely).
Teamwork & collaboration — Valuing the people you work with, their opinions, and their right to have them.
Constant self-education — Keeping up with the daily changes in specs, requirements, tools, opportunities, and pitfalls within the realm of front-end development.
Maintaining proper work-life balance — Resisting the urge to sit motionless (save reaching for snacks/drinks) while you spend “just four more hours” figuring out that console error.
